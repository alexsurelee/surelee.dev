## Setup

This project uses `yarn` as its preferred package manager.

Sass is the preferred styling tool, meaning sass modules are used within this project.

`typescript-plugin-css-modules` has been added to assist with access to css styles. To enable 'jump to definition' and proper typing, you should [use the workspace version of typescript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-the-workspace-version-of-typescript). **You need to set this, even if the version of VSCode matches the workspace version.**
